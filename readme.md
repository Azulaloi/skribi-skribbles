# Skribi Examples

This repository contains my Skribi usage examples and useful snippets.

To use one, place the `.eta` and `.css` files into your templates directory, and the `.js` files into your scripts directory.

The files have been prefixed with `az_` to avoid getting mixed up with your own files.

If you have questions or requests, feel free to submit an issue.
